# RSAN
## 1.Preparing Dataset and Model
Datasets can be download from Xian et al. (CVPR2017) and take them into dir data.
## 2.Requirements
The code implementation of RSAN mainly based on PyTorch. All of our experiments run in Python 3.8.8.
## 3.Runing
Before running commands, you can set the hyperparameters in config.py. Please run the following commands and testing RSAN on different datasets:
$ python ./image-scripts/run-cub.py       #CUB
$ python ./image-scripts/run-sun.py       #SUN
$ python ./image-scripts/run-flo.py       #FLO
$ python ./image-scripts/run-awa1.py      #AWA1
$ python ./image-scripts/run-awa2.py      #AWA2
